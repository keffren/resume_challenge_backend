# AWS CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE BACK END

This repository is a part of the [AWS-Cloud-Resume-Challenge](https://github.com/keffren/aws_cloud_resume_challenge), and its objective is to serve as the CI/CD Pipeline for the backend. It contains the API that interacts with AWS DynamoDB.

> The version of the CI/CD pipeline is V1, which means it can't be started manually because it's only supported in V2.
